inputstream.ffmpegdirect Add-on for Kodi 21.0-ALPHA3, Compiled for LG webOS.
pvr.hts-tvhead client Add-on for Kodi 21.0-ALPHA3, Compiled for LG webOS.

It is not installed by Kodi via .ZIP as usual, but must be copied manually to TV.

Unzip the pvr.vuplus.zip and copy the folder pvr.vuplus to `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/org.xbmc.kodi/addons/` on the TV using FileZilla. 
Have fun with it.
